Simple Blog Web Application using Django

## Project Overview
**Problem**: Create a Simple Blog Web Application using Django.

**Description**:
You are tasked with building a basic blog application where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The application should have the following features:

- View all blog posts.
- View a single blog post.
- Create a new blog post.
- Edit an existing blog post.
- Delete a blog post.

**Implementation**:
To implement this, follow these steps:

- Create a new Django project using `django-admin startproject projectname`.
- Create a new Django app using `python manage.py startapp blog`.
- Migrate and Create superuser.
- Define a model for blog posts in the `blog/models.py` file.
- Register the Post model in the blog/admin.py file to make it accessible in the Django admin interface.
- Again, makemigrations and migrate.
- Create views for handling CRUD operations on blog posts in the blog/views.py file.
- Define functions for listing all blog posts, viewing a single blog post, creating a new blog post, updating an existing blog post, and deleting a blog post.
- Define URL patterns in the blog/urls.py file to map URLs to the views created in step 5.
- Create HTML templates for rendering the list of blog posts, viewing a single blog post, creating a new blog post, and editing an existing blog post.
- Implement form handling in the views to process user input for creating and editing blog posts.
- Use Django's built-in form handling and CSRF protection to handle form submissions securely.
- Include links and buttons in the HTML templates to navigate between different pages and perform CRUD operations on blog posts.
- Style the web application using CSS to improve the user interface and experience.

This project will help you understand Django's fundamentals, including models, views, templates, URLs, and forms, while also introducing you to CRUD operations in Django. You can further enhance this project by adding features such as user authentication, comments, categories/tags for blog posts, and pagination for the list of blog posts.
